# Dynamic Array Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays in Ethereum smart contracts. It includes a simple data structure for managing accounts and provides functions to add accounts and retrieve a list of all accounts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Usage**: This contract uses dynamic arrays to store a list of accounts (`admins`). It shows how dynamic arrays can be employed to manage and retrieve data efficiently on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Add Admins**: The contract includes a function (`addAdmin`) to add new administrators (accounts) to the dynamic array.

- **Get All Admins**: It provides a function (`getAllAdmins`) to retrieve a list of all administrators (accounts) stored in the dynamic array.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you'll need to deploy it to a compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum). You can deploy it using tools like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation) or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract through a blockchain wallet or build a decentralized application (dApp) on top of it.

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network.

2. Use the `addAdmin` function to add new administrators (accounts) to the dynamic array. You can provide a name, surname, and initial balance for each administrator.

3. Use the `getAllAdmins` function to retrieve a list of all administrators (accounts) stored in the dynamic array.

4. Build a dApp or use blockchain wallet interfaces to interact with the contract.
